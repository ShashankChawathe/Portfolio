    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a final-year BBA LL.B. student at IFIM Law School, Bengaluru, with a strong academic and professional focus on litigation, legal research, and dispute resolution. Through diverse internships across High Courts and reputed law firms, I have developed hands-on experience in civil, criminal, and commercial litigation, along with a sound understanding of Indirect Taxation, Criminal laws and Family Laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work has involved drafting pleadings, conducting in-depth legal research, preparing litigation strategy, and attending court proceedings. I have actively contributed to Law School Competitions, Publications, and Student Committees, honing both my legal acumen and leadership skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am driven by a deep interest in the evolving legal landscape and committed to building a practice grounded in integrity, strategic thinking, and impactful advocacy.
